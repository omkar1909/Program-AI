# A* algorithm is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. 
# It is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal.
# The algorithm efficiently plots a path between multiple nodes, or points, on the graph.

# In this case, it can solve a simple game problem by finding a efficient path between any 2 nodes (or places on the map in a game)
