# The N queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. 
# Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

''' Backtracking solution - The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a column, 
    we check for clashes with already placed queens. In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, we mark this row and column as part 
    of the solution. If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and return false. '''
